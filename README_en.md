# Project Name

Project - Automation and Compilation of Links in HTML5

> This project represents the first contact with developing a script in Python3. Therefore, it should be considered the first step in a long journey with this programming language and web development.

> This site was created with Python3 and HTML5 as part of my web development learning process.  
> It is an automatic link compiler generated through a script.

## Functions

- Create a script in Python3 to automate online searches;
- Generate an HTML5 file containing all the compiled links from the searches.

## Technologies Used

- Software - Visual Studio Code (for coding);
- HTML5 (site structure);
- Python3 (to generate the script);
- Git (to interact between local and remote repositories via command line);
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (to host the site for free).

## Repository Folder Structure

└── README.md

## Note

Since this is an initial, simplified, and experimental project, CSS3 was not included for styling and responsiveness.  
The goal was to ensure the links were generated and functional so even the browser's default style reset was not applied.  
The main objective was to understand better how to use a script to automate manual searches and how an HTML5 file can be generated via Python3.
